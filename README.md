# Customer-Segmentation

BACKGROUND
--

You would need to work on the ‘purchase’ dataset of a retail store (we have used this dataset
extensively in MKTA class) to come out with other interesting segments (using RFM) and
recommend marketing actions

TASK TO BE PERFORMED
--

There will be two primary tasks:

1. Based on R, F, M variables, build a 4-segment solution (using K-Means), whichever is
more meaningful and actionable to you. Define each of these segments and select the
one most important segments for this business to act upon. Why do you think this
segment is important? What Marketing actions do you propose to take, to target
and derive more business from this segment?

2. Using R, F, M try building segments which are more from the managerial
implementation angle and common-sense-led actionable. For example, (i) by giving
scores based on R, F, M and creating a score for each customer and then segmenting
them OR (ii) by creating two groups High / Low for each of the variables R, F
and M and then looking at the all possible 2*2*2 = 8 segments.
Select the two most important segments for this business to act upon. Why do you
think these two segments are important? What Marketing actions do you propose
to take, to target and derive more business from these two segments?
